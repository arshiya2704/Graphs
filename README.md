Directed/ Undirected graphs using technologies:

• NetworkX

Features: 

• Draw directed/undirected graphs</br>
• Set the positions of points on the graph</br>
• Use of circular/random graphs</br>
• Calculate degree_centrality</br>
• Calculate closeness_centrality</br>
• Calculate betweenness_centrality</br>
• Calculate page rank</br>

Steps to run the application:
1. Open the terminal
2. Enter the startup folder
3. Type "jupyter notebook" to launch and run

Below are some screenshots demonstrating the application:
